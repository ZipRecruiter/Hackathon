## Ideas

- Getting responses to reference checks is arduous. Tools to help schedule and improve the response rate of your references would be a huge improvement to the status quo of manually scheduling calls and calendaring events. Most appointment setting and calendaring tools that exist are geared towards sales and do not meet the needs of HR professionals.

- Improving employers hiring funnels is a big business. It can take a year of interviewing to develop a funnel that takes feedback from interviewers and turns that into a rubric for determining if a hire would do well in an interview. Can you come up with software that can analyze the feedback of an interview and give instance insight? Can you convert interview feedback into screening questions to ask before a candidate is brought in? Doing so would resolve a major pain point for the industry.

- Job seekers have huge amounts of public data like portfolios, StackOverflow accounts, GitHub repos, Devientart accounts, IMDB credits, and many others, that are not always represented in their resumes. Can you help them manage it in one place?

- Resume writing is hard. Job seekers struggle to highlight their successes. Can you help them do better?
